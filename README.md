# BitDogLab

BitDogLab, an initiative of the School Project 4.0 at Unicamp, is an educational tool devoted to electronics and computing. Based on Raspberry Pi Pico H or W, it allows users to explore, assemble, and program using components mounted on its board and also external ones connected in an organized and secure manner. Meticulously selected, the components foster hands-on learning, encouraging users to enhance programming and electronics skills synergistically and progressively. This enriching platform offers a vibrant experience, immersing users in a colourful, auditory, and synesthetic learning environment. Additionally, BitDogLab is optimized for programming assisted by large language models (LLM), like GPT-4, facilitating a more intuitive learning guided by a tireless tutor. Aimed at pre-university education, BitDogLab aims to catalyze the incorporation of educational technology, providing a robust and flexible tool uniquely integrated into students' learning journey.

A hallmark of BitDogLab is that its project is entirely open, allowing it to be freely copied, manufactured, assembled, and improved by users. More information at: https://github.com/Fruett/BitDogLab

This repository holds open-source design files for BitDogLab, an educational STEAM tool. It includes various components like LEDs, buzzers, buttons, and more, promoting collaborative modification and enhancement of STEAM education.
